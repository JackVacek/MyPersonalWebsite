# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# My Personal Website

This project is a personal website developed using React, Vite, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Formspree. It showcases my skills in front-end development with a focus on creating a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience. The project utilizes React for building UI components, Vite for optimized development and build processes, and JavaScript for adding dynamic functionalities. CSS is used to ensure a clean and consistent design, while HTML provides a solid and accessible structure. This website serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my proficiency with these technologies.
